questions: what is the difference between attributes and product description?
ideas:
    - break down product description and search terms into bag of words
    - want to have some kind of interaction that notes if the words show up in both categories or not

    - instead of counting bags of words, could just try factor for not in either, in search term only, in description only, in both

potential issues: 
    - Data could be too sparse or too few search both terms 
    - how to model response? numbers need to be between 1 and 3 but continuous. Beta regression?
todo: need some summary stats...
